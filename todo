bugs:
- t3 sentry rockets do no dmg
- direct hit bot pipes do no dmg
- bots attack spectator camera if player dead (on red or blu team)
- bot hitboxes don't get scaled with the model, at least for rockets
- bot walking anim is broken
- bots tilt sideways when playing attack anim
- melee bots take forever to change direction when walking
- bots can get stuck in the air, gravity broken?
- bots try to attack without LOS instead of moving
- bots overlap eachother

map:
- killtrigger if falling off

bot:
- bot unstuck
  - if no movement in x secs while there should be,
    pick a random nearby nav spot as target
