todo:
- show enemy tower, bot healthbars

- item_currencypack_custom
- money idea 1:
  - kill money dropped by bots
  - give money/xp directly to player who got the kill
- money idea 2:
  - dropped money is colored by team
  - each team can only pick up their own money
  - must get close to mobs to get dosh
  - other team can deny you reaching it / do damage
  - everyone is ranged in tf2, can't really punish people trying to last hit
  - mobs only drop money if last hitted?
    - maybe not relevant? money is only gained if picked up
    - last hitting is not the goal

- maintain player script through respawns
- bot unstuck
  - if no movement in x secs while there should be,
    pick a random nearby nav spot as target
- entity for lane nodes
- entity for bot spawn point
  - bot type, team, lane index
- fountain = big dispenser with sentry gun on top, both invuln
- fix bots attacking spectator camera if player dead (on red or blu team)

ideas:
- intel = aegis of the immortal
- siege unit = demoman in cart
