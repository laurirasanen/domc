todo:
- money attracted towards nearby players

player progression:
- buy mvm upgrades with money?

misc:
- towers drop money
- show enemy tower, bot healthbars
- add sentry to fountain
- fix bots attacking spectator camera if player dead (on red or blu team)

money:
- item_currencypack_custom
- dropped money is colored by team
- each team can only pick up their own money
- must get close to mobs to get dosh
- other team can deny you reaching it / do damage
- everyone is ranged in tf2, can't really punish people trying to last hit
- mobs only drop money if last hitted?
  - maybe not relevant? money is only gained if picked up
  - last hitting is not the goal

bot:
- bot unstuck
  - if no movement in x secs while there should be,
    pick a random nearby nav spot as target

ideas:
- intel = aegis of the immortal
- siege unit = demoman in cart
