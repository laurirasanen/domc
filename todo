bugs:
- t3 sentry rockets do no dmg
- bots attack spectator camera if player is dead but on red or blu team
- bots tilt sideways when playing victory taunt anim
- bots can get stuck in the air, how to gravity with loco?
- bots overlap eachother
- bot unstuck doesn't work, always kills

map:
- killtrigger if falling off
- power runes
- move mid lane t2 sentry forward so it doesn't shoot side lanes pushing to t3
