bugs:
- t3 sentry rockets do no dmg
- direct hit bot pipes do no dmg
- bots attack spectator camera if player dead (on red or blu team)
- bot hitboxes don't get scaled with the model, at least for rockets

map:
- killtrigger if falling off

bot:
- bot unstuck
  - if no movement in x secs while there should be,
    pick a random nearby nav spot as target
