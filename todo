playtest issues:
- server starts lagging when a lot of bots present
  - measure & optimize bot think
  - get rid of siege pipes, these are a pain anyway
    - just hitscan + smoke/fire/explosion particles
- late joiners shouldn't start at level 1
  - maybe equal to lowest level in lobby?
  - keep player level if they disconnect/rejoin?

bugs:
- t3 sentry rockets do no dmg
- bots tilt sideways when playing victory taunt anim

map:
- power runes
- clutter sightlines more, too open for now

features:
- sniper should be able to headshot bots
- spy disguise should work against bots
- spy bot sapping?
- make engineer viable
  - tower repair?
    - check building_healed event
  - scale player buildings with lvl
    - check player_*object events

misc:
- replace backdoor protection particles
