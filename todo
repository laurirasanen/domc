todo:
- show enemy tower, bot healthbars
- kill money dropped by bots
- give money/xp directly to player who got the kill
- maintain player script through respawns
- bot unstuck
  - if no movement in x secs while there should be,
    pick a random nearby nav spot as target
- entity for lane nodes
- entity for bot spawn point
  - bot type, team, lane index
- towers = sentry guns, increasing tiers
- fountain = big dispenser with sentry gun on top, both invuln

ideas:
- intel = aegis of the immortal
- siege unit = demoman in cart
